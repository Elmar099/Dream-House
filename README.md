## Built a model to predict housing prices in California using the housing dataset 
### In this project I use the following regression models: Gradient Boosting and Random Forest
More detail about the dataset:

#### longitude - Longitude of the house
#### latitude - Latitude of the house
#### housing_median_age - Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
#### total_rooms - Total number of rooms within a block
#### total_bedrooms - Total number of bedrooms within a block
#### population - Total number of people residing within a block
#### households - Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
#### median_income - Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
#### median_house_value - Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
#### ocean_proximity - Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea
